!1Are we there yet?
!0No, we still have a while to go. Besides, your training is not complete.
!2I challenge you to a D-D-D-D-DUEL!!!
!1Huh? Man, such blatant copyright infrin-
!0*ACHEM* Let's accept the challenge. It will be a nice learning experience.
!0I can see some Barracks on the field. They allow you to deploy additional units by expending gold.
!1Fine. But you have to guide me.
!0Of course! (to self) She'd die instantly without guidance...
!1I heard that!
!2I'm hearing the sobbing of a defeated girl already! Hurry up and let's D-D-D-D-DUEL!!!
!0Alright, now Right Click your barrack to see the units you can spawn. 
!0Left Click a unit on the right to select it, and Left Click a green square to deploy the unit. Each unit costs gold to deploy.
!1How do I get gold to spend?
!0The nexus provides 5 Gold per turn.
!1Cool!
!0Note how the barracks turn dark grey after deploying a unit. Each can only deploy 1 unit each turn.
!0For reference, I'll explain the units that you can select in detail, so pay attention!
!0Swordsmen are slow, but they are powerful. You should deploy these to protect your back line, as they are easily killed.
!0Archers are long-ranged, but have low HP. They are a safe source of damage, but are weak against non-living units.
!0Paladins are the tanks of the game. They have low ATK but very high HP and SPD. Rush these out to weaken important enemy units.
!0Scouts are fast and have low cost. They are immune to all land terrain effects, including roads and mountains! They are perfect for capturing structures.
!0Trebuchets are indirect fire units. They can't attack and move on the same turn. However, they deal extreme damage and have long RNG.
!0Grenadiers are essential for capturing, since they are strong against non-living units like structures. They are very mobile and deal a good amount of damage.
!0Carriers are used to move units around the map quickly. Right Click them to both take in a unit or drop off a unit.
!0(Note: Carriers are only exhausted after dropping off a unit. Picking up a unit costs no energy.)
!1Wow that's a lot of information! I should press [R] if I ever need a refresher on what each unit does!
!0That's right! I'm sure you can take over from here. I'll watch from a distance.
!1OK!
