!0Nicely done!
!1Thanks! I'm glad the hardest lesson is over!
!0We're not even halfway back to the city yet! I've got a lot more to teach you.
!1Darn! I can already see some new units...why are they grey?
!0Grey units are neutral. Those units can be captured by placing allied units directly next to them. 
!0At the end of each turn, the number of units nearby that are not fully exhausted are added to the counter.
!1So you're telling me that if I attack with a unit, it can't capture that turn?
!0Yep! Fully exhausted units can't capture structures.
!0If the counter reaches 3, the structure becomes yours.
!1Can I capture enemy structures?
!0Yes! But you have to neutralize it first by reducing the structure's HP to 0.
!0Structures can never die: if they are reduced to 0 HP, they become neutral and capturable.
!1Hmm, so even if I neutralize a structure, the enemy can recapture very quickly if I don't take care of other enemy units?
!0Yes...If an enemy can manage to get 3 of their units next to the neutralized structure, it can be captured in just 1 turn!
!1I'll keep that in mind...but I still don't know what each structure does!
!0Capturable structures include: #Barracks (Deploy land units),#Villages (Gain gold per turn),
!0Towers (Shoot bullets at enemies),#and Harbors (Not introduced yet, but they deploy naval units).
!1Alright, I think I'm ready!
!0Remember: If there are 3 living enemy units nearby a structure, they will likely be able to recapture it if you kill the structure!
!0Also, only units that are NOT fully exhausted can capture!
!1OK!
